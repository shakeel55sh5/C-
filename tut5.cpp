// "<<" this is called insertion operator
// ">>" this is called extraction operator

// Explanation
// first make two variables that should empty b/c in last coustmer fill taht variabel
// we use cin for taking input from coustemer and necessary use >> 
// in first we show to coustmer that chice number for this purpose write cout then for coustmer write use cin
// same work in second line 
// in last we write  the first variabel and second varaibel that choose coustmer to add both them
