// in this simple first write our c++ code then write after first main function write some int data types and print it 
// in above we simple make two varibale of int data types 
// then in output (cout) when we need then we write variabel name and take output of that variable
// Remeber 
// when you write a new variabel in output or something else then use << then write other name or string etc

// Remeber 
// instead of same varaiabel type i mean data type use different line instead of it use in one line like in above comment line give same output
// when you use two varibael in one line then after one variabel use , then simple write varibael name and value 

// Remeber 
// for break line mean from this statement write our output in next line then use \n 
// like in above case we write in float daata type we write \n therefore our output of float data type in next line

// Remeber 
// in char data type we use and write just one character 
// if we write char data type and value of char is more than one character then it give us a big error b/c char is just for one letter
// if we use more than one character in char data type then the last character or alphatet will show and give a error also

// In boolean data type we write bool instead of full name boolean
// if some thing is true in bool then c++ give us 1 and if false something then it give us 0
